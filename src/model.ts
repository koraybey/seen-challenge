// Using Zod because:
// 1) Eliminates the need for type declarations with schema type inference.
// 2) Error method includes an argument for custom error message.
// 3) Comes with a variety of string-specific validations. For example, I noticed transaction data contains ISO 8601 datetime with the time offset. I can enforce it with "z.string().datetime()" method and add sub-second decimal precision if necessary.
